# DeltaFlight

##Steps to replicate SQL result
1. Sql query a,ached is pre,y self-explanatory, need to replace <flight> with the name of actual Dummy_flight table and execute the code.
2. Data provide doesn’t have any duplicates, and each flightkey has only one record, so I created a sample flight table with duplicates to test if code logic works; simply un- comment the beginning secIon of the query, run the sample generaIon code.

##Steps to replicate Python result
1. Please save the original Dummy_Flight_Leg_Data.csv (with the unstructured data at the beginning of data) under Download folder, and run the python script.
2. Same as above, I created a sample file “Test”, and output into “test_w_mrs”, both files are a,ached in the zip.
3. Python HTML and script a,ached in the zip.
